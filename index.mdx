# Auth Provider Cost Analysis: Under \$100/Month Challenge

**Logto emerges as the clear winner at just \$64/month**, while Kinde and Auth0 both exceed budget constraints by significant margins. For a startup requiring 250,000 MAUs and 30,000 teams, only Logto offers a viable solution within the specified budget.

## Critical Budget Reality Check

Your \$100/month budget creates an immediate constraint that eliminates most traditional authentication providers. **Auth0 would cost \$10,000-50,000\+ monthly** for 250k MAUs, while **Kinde estimates \$2,000-4,000\+ monthly** for similar volume. Logto's recent pivot away from MAU-based pricing makes it uniquely positioned for high-volume, budget-conscious startups.

The authentication industry typically prices based on monthly active users, with costs scaling dramatically beyond 10k-25k MAUs. Your requirements of 250k MAUs with extensive team support represent enterprise-level usage that most providers price accordingly. However, Logto's unlimited MAU model with flat pricing breaks this conventional approach.
